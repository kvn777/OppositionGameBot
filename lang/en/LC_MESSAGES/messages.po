"Prologue\n"
"\n"
"Opposition is a psychological game (one of those games, the familiar Mafia). Players are either the Opposition, led by an Opposition Leader*, whose goal is to overthrow the current government, or they become undercover agents, seeking to foil the Opposition's plans, led by a Prosecutor*.\n"
"\n"
"The Opposition wins if they successfully hold three rallies. The victory goes to Government Agents if the 3 rallies are failed. The agents can also win if the Opposition fails to organise a rally team (5 disruptions in the vote for the composition of the rally). In addition, if the Opposition successfully holds three rallies, "
"the Prosecutor arrests one of the Opposition members and if it is the Leader of the Opposition - the Agents of the Government win*.\n"
"\n"
"The main thing about this game is that players can express their opinions at any time. Communication, intuitive insights, lying, bluffing, logic, interaction and strategic thinking are essential to winning this game. But please don't correspond in private to keep the game fair and interesting.\n"
"\t'* Extra roles are only entered when playing with 7 people or more.\n"
"\n"
"Rules of the game.\n"
"All players are randomly assigned roles (received in their inbox), the roles are divided into Opposition and Government Agents, as the number of players increases, new roles are introduced and new team options become available.Government agents are told (in the private area) the names of other agents (Except in games of 10 or "
"more people, where the role of Secret Agent is added and not revealed to anyone, but acting on behalf of Government Agents)One of the players (either a Government Agent or an Opposition member) is chosen as the rally organiser and chooses the required number of players for the rally (I will write down how many players to "
"choose at what point)All players then discuss the choice of Rally Leader and at the same time publicly vote on whether or not to accept the composition of the team (the voting form will be in the chatroom)\n"
"If the vote for the rally line-up fails, the turn is passed to the next player and he is appointed Rally Leader, chooses a new rally line-up, etc. If the composition of the rally fails 5 times, the Agents win.If the vote for the rally line-up is successful - an anonymous vote for the rally will be sent to those going to the "
"rally. Opposition members will have no choice but to vote for the rally, while government agents will be allowed to vote both for and against the rally. If there is at least one vote against* the rally, the rally is deemed not to have taken place. (*Except for one mission with a 7-10 person game, where two votes against will "
"be required)\n"
"If the rally takes place, the Opposition team gets a victory point.If the rally fails, the Agents' team gets a point.Game continues until one team gets 3 points.\n"
"\n"
"Roles in the game\n"
"\n"
"Up to 7 people in the game are just ordinary Opposition members and ordinary Government Agents.\n"
"For games with 7 to 9 players, the roles are added: Opposition Leader, who is notified at the start (by the bot in the Personal Line) of all (except Secret Agent) Government Agents and the Prosecutor, who, in case of defeat of the Agents, arrests one of the Opposition members and if it is their Leader - the Agents win.\n"
"In a game of 10 or more:\n"
"The Agents get the roles: Provocateur and Secret Agent, the Provocateur's identity becomes known to the Leader's bodyguard and the Secret Agent's identity is not known to anyone.A Bodyguard of the Leader is added to the Opposition team, who is told the identity of the Opposition Leader and Provocateur (without specifying who "
"is who), his goal is to protect the Leader and if the Opposition wins, the Prosecutor will arrest the Bodyguard (as a possible Leader) or another ordinary member of the Opposition."
